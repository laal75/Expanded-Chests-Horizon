"""The mod's version, kept in VERSION and copied everywhere else that names it.

    python tools/version.py            check that every file agrees with VERSION
    python tools/version.py 0.3.0      set a new version: VERSION, the manifests, Cargo.toml,

Versions are semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH): PATCH for fixes, MINOR for new blocks or features,
MAJOR when a world saved with the old version would lose or change something. Tag each release
`v<version>` and attach dist/'s files to its GitHub release.
